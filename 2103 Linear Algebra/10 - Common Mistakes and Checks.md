# Common Mistakes and Checks

## Mistakes
- Forgetting a zero coefficient (missing variable) in the augmented matrix.
- Applying a row operation to the left side but not the right side.
- Arithmetic slip when distributing a multiple across a row.
- Creating fractions too early and then compounding errors.

## Checks (fast)
1) Plug solution back into the ORIGINAL equations (quick verification).
2) Watch for inconsistent row:
   $$
   [0\ 0\ \cdots\ 0 \mid \text{nonzero} ]
  $$
3) In RREF: pivot columns must have zeros everywhere except the pivot 1.
