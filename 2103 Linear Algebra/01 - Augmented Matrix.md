# Augmented Matrix

## Definition
An **augmented matrix** is the coefficient matrix with the constants appended as the last column.

For a system

the augmented matrix is:

## Why we use it
- Keeps bookkeeping clean.
- Row operations become mechanical.
- Scales to many equations/variables.

## How to build it (fast)
1. Pick a variable order (e.g., \(x,y,z\)).
2. Each equation → one row.
3. Missing variable? Put 0.
4. Constants go after the bar.
