Gaussian Elimination can be worked in both direction, although it is best to teach the usual standard way of going from Augmented Matrix $->$ REF $->$ Do Back Substitution

The method will automatically works for the operations to be reversed obtaining a Lower Triangular Matrix ($L$) instead of a typical REF (Row Echelon Form) which is an Upper Triangular Matrix ($U$) and then do a Forward Substitution. (But again, it is more standard and easy to teach as Upper Triangular Matrix is more standard as REF)

This property of supporting both ways can be described in multiple terms:

#### 1. Directional Invariance
#### 2. Duality in Elimination
#### 3. Reflective Property of LU Elimination
#### 4. Persymmetric View
