Gaussian Elimination can be worked in both direction, although it is best to teach the usual standard way of going from Augmented Matrix $->$ REF $->$ Do Back Substitution

The method will automatically works for the operations to be reversed obtaining a Lower Triangular Matrix ($L$) instead of a typical REF (Row Echelon Form) which is an Upper Triangular Matrix ($U$) and then do a Forward Subs
