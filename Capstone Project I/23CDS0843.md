# Web-Based Inventory and Supply Chain Analytics System for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)

## Overview
Many SMEs in Sri Lanka rely on spreadsheets or manual methods to manage inventory and suppliers, often leading to stock inaccuracies, inefficient reorder decisions, and limited visibility into demand and supplier performance. Full-scale enterprise ERP systems are usually costly and complex for these businesses. This project proposes a lightweight, web-based system that enables SMEs to manage inventory and supplier data efficiently while providing analytical insights. The system will support product and supplier management, warehouse tracking, and transaction logging, along with dashboards for inventory turnover, demand trends, reorder recommendations, and supplier performance metrics. Built using a PostgreSQL database, a Python backend, and a React/Next.js frontend, the system will offer multi-organization support, role-based access, and real-time reporting, providing a practical solution tailored for SMEs.

## Objective
- Develop a relational database to store inventory, supplier, and transaction data.  
- Implement modules for inventory management, supplier management, and warehouse tracking.  
- Provide analytical features for demand trends, inventory turnover, reorder alerts, and supplier performance metrics.  
- Create a user-friendly web interface for SMEs to monitor and manage operations efficiently.  
- Demonstrate a scalable, lightweight alternative to complex ERP systems suitable for small businesses.
