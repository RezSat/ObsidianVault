## **Single-Product E-Shop**

## Project Overview
The proposed project is a **web application for selling a single product online**, designed to resemble a polished e-commerce template. The application will allow users to view product details, add the product to a cart, and simulate checkout. This project demonstrates skills in **full-stack web development, database integration, and responsive UI design** while remaining simple and achievable within the Capstone timeline.

## Objectives
- Design and implement a clean, professional single-product website template.
- Enable basic e-commerce functionality such as product display, cart management, and order tracking.
- Integrate a backend database to store orders and relevant user interactions.
- Build a responsive interface suitable for both desktop and mobile users.

## Features
- **Product Page:** Displays product image, description, price, and key details.
- **Cart Functionality:** Users can add the product to a shopping cart.
- **Checkout Simulation:** Users can submit orders (payment simulation; real payment integration not required for Capstone).
- **Order Storage:** Orders are recorded in a database for administrative tracking.
- **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js with Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS for simplicity)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or Supabase for simplicity
- **Deployment:** Vercel for frontend, Supabase backend (or alternative hosting solutions)

## Project Feasibility
- Minimal dataset required; mock data can be used for orders and product information.
- The project focuses on core **full-stack development skills** with a realistic application scenario.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional single-product e-commerce web application.
- Demonstration of CRUD operations, frontend-backend integration, and responsive design principles.
- A project template that can be expanded to multiple products or real payment integration in the future.
