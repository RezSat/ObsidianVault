## 1. Introduction  

This project proposes the development of a web-based system for managing university venue bookings. The system will allow students and staff to request venues such as auditoriums or lecture halls, while authorized administrators can approve or reject these requests through a centralized platform.

The goal is to replace manual or email-based booking processes with a structured and efficient digital system.

## 2. Problem Statement  

Currently, venue booking processes may involve manual coordination, which can result in:

- Scheduling conflicts  
- Delayed approvals  
- Lack of transparency in availability  
- Poor tracking of booking records  

A centralized system is needed to streamline this process.

## 3. Project Objectives  

The objectives of this project are:

1. To develop a web-based venue booking system.  
2. To implement automated time-slot conflict detection.  
3. To provide an approval mechanism for booking requests.  
4. To maintain a digital record of venue usage.

## 4. Proposed System  

The system will include:

### User Role (Student / Staff)
- View available venues  
- Submit booking requests  
- Track request status  

### Approver Role (Dean / Administrator)
- View pending booking requests  
- Approve or reject bookings  

### Core Features
- Venue listing  
- Booking request submission  
- Automatic detection of overlapping bookings  
- Status tracking (Pending / Approved / Rejected)  
- Venue usage statistics  
- Most frequently booked venues  
- Peak booking times  
- Booking trends over time

## 5. Technology Stack  

- Frontend: Next.js (React)  
- Backend: RESTful API (Node.js / Next.js API routes) 
- Database: PostgreSQL  (possibly supabase)
- Role-based authentication

## 6. Expected Outcome  

The system will provide a structured, efficient, and transparent method for managing university venue reservations. It will reduce scheduling conflicts and improve administrative efficiency.
