Here’s some information about the Capstone Project for Data Science I:

As part of the project, students are required to develop a web-based application. Examples include a sports management system, examination center system, healthcare system, or a stadium booking system where, once a reservation is made, the same slot cannot be booked by another user.

Students may use different technologies for the front end and back end, such as Java, Python, and web frameworks like Django, even if these were not fully covered during lectures. Self-study is encouraged, and students are welcome to explore and apply new technologies where suitable. The system must include a database backend such as MySQL, and detailed instructions will be shared later. Modern front-end technologies like JavaScript and React can also be used.

After selecting a project topic, students must prepare a short project discussion and present it to their assigned project supervisor. This discussion should include:
	•	The project title
	•	A clear problem description
	•	The technologies to be used (front end, back end, database)
	•	A brief justification for choosing those technologies

Each student or group will be assigned a supervisor. If the supervisor feels the project is not appropriate for the expected academic level, either too simple or too advanced (for example, heavy machine learning–based systems), the project may be rejected.

If a project is rejected, students must revise the idea or choose a new topic based on the supervisor’s feedback and resubmit it. The supervisor will guide students on how to improve the project scope and technical approach.
